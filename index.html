      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Cloud Engineer with a strong foundation in designing and implementing robust infrastructure on the AWS platform.
        Proven success in driving security and cloud best practices, significantly reducing mean time to deploy, and
        optimizing cloud costs. I specialize in AWS cloud solutions, Kafka streaming platforms, and Kubernetes container
        orchestration to deliver efficient software delivery and operational excellence.

              <p>
                As the technical owner and lead for Kafka at the OCC, I have a proven track record in designing and
                architecting multi-region, event-driven cloud solutions on AWS, leveraging key technologies such as
                Kubernetes for container orchestration. My expertise is crucial to the OCC's ongoing cloud migration
                journey, the "Renaissance" program. The OCC, the world's largest equity derivatives clearing
                organization and a designated Systemically Important Financial Market Utility (SIFMU), faces unique
                challenges in this transition. My expertise is instrumental in overcoming these challenges, ensuring the
                seamless migration of critical systems like Kafka while maintaining the highest levels of security and
                resilience required for a SIFMU.  
              </p>

              <p>
                I've leveraged Terraform for efficient infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for streamlined
                configuration management, ensuring seamless deployments across our evolving cloud environment. I've
                implemented robust CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub, specifically optimized for multi-region
                Kafka implementations, significantly improving our development and release processes. I've also actively
                contributed to the design of cloud solutions, mainly focusing on Kafka-related architectures, often
                running on Kubernetes clusters for scalability and fault tolerance. My contributions are vital in
                driving the OCC towards becoming the first SIFMU to successfully transition to the cloud, setting a
                precedent for other financial institutions.

                <p>
                  As Lead DevOps Engineer at Xsell Technologies, I spearheaded the transformation of our infrastructure
                  from manually deployed EC2 instances to a modern, scalable Kubernetes architecture. I leveraged my
                  extensive cloud expertise (AWS/Azure) and proficiency in technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, and
                  Ansible to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration. This shift streamlined deployments
                  and empowered us to implement event-based autoscaling using Kubernetes native tools like KEDA,
                  optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I championed continuous improvement by establishing best practices in cloud security and architecture.
                  I actively participated in review boards to maintain the highest standards, particularly critical for
                  FinTech and healthcare compliance. I implemented cutting-edge CI/CD pipelines, adhering to strict
                  governance policies and ensuring secure and efficient software delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My deep understanding of Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Snowflake enabled me to architect robust, event-driven
                  architectures for real-time data processing, vital for our AI-powered platform. Additionally, I
                  incorporated the ELK Stack for comprehensive observability, enabling proactive troubleshooting and
                  performance optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my tenure, I consistently drove innovation, seeking new opportunities to enhance Xsell
                  Technologies' performance and solidify its position as a leader in customer engagement solutions.
