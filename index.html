              I have empowered Twitch streamers by providing personalized support and developing software and tools to
              improve their streaming experience. I managed essential services such as Twitch channel bots, backups,
              RTMP/encoding servers, and game servers. By optimizing server health for real-time applications with a
              substantial user base, I ensured smooth and reliable streaming. Proactive monitoring, software upgrades,
