                <p>
                  As Lead DevOps Engineer at Xsell Technologies, I leveraged extensive cloud infrastructure design and
                  architecture knowledge to deliver dynamic, scalable, and secure DevOps solutions for AWS and Azure
                  environments, utilizing technologies such as Kubernetes, EC2, RDS, DocumentDB, ElasticCache, and MSK.
                  I drove continuous improvement by defining and executing best practices in cloud security and
                  architecture, and participating in regular security and architecture review boards. I implemented
                  cutting-edge CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, Github Actions, and Harness.io, adhering to
                  strict governance policies for FinTech and healthcare. I provided expert guidance in designing and
                  architecting new applications and frameworks, ensuring alignment with company goals and regulatory
                  requirements. I automated infrastructure provisioning, management, and configuration using Terraform,
                  Ansible, and Python, leading to streamlined deployments. Proficient in Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Snowflake,
                  I delivered robust, scalable, and secure solutions, incorporating messaging and event-driven
                  architectures for real-time data processing. I also leveraged the ELK Stack for comprehensive
                  observability and troubleshooting. I was constantly seeking new opportunities to drive innovation and
                  enhance the company's performance.

            <p>
              I have empowered Twitch streamers by providing personalized support and developing software and tools to
              improve their streaming experience. I managed essential services such as Twitch channel bots, backups,
              RTMP/encoding servers, and game servers. By optimizing server health for real-time applications with a
              substantial user base, I ensured smooth and reliable streaming. Proactive monitoring, software upgrades,
              and issue resolution have been crucial in maintaining top performance. Additionally, I've utilized a
              custom Borg-based backup utility and implemented automation scripts to streamline operations.
              Collaborating closely with developers, I've contributed to troubleshooting and introducing new features,
              resulting in a stable streaming environment with minimal downtime.
